Just some basics for generating an XXZ hamiltonian and field term. Maybe will grow into a more sophisticated package for analyzing thermal properties of disordered spin models.

Includes:
- some spin-half basics
- different geometries to sample blockaded positions from
- a basic interface to convert particle positions to interaction strength (only `PowerLaw` is implemented)
- methods for generating an XXZ Hamiltonian and field term
- methods for computing thermal quantum ensembles
- basic support for entanglement entropy
